# Improved-Mask-R-CNN-for-nuclei-segmentation

This repository contains the implementational parts of the COMPAY draft.

For easy readability and understanding, it is composed of notebooks for each part of the paper - one is for going though the dataset with the costum dataset-classes containg H-stain + RGB + Distance data. Another is for illustrating the instance based merging algorithm via average voting. The other ones are for simple detection, validation, and training of the models, as well as explainations for the costumized inferrence strategies presented.
